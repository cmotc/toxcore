N\+O\+T\+E\+: only the protocol section is up to date, the rest needs to be rewritten.

Follows pretty much the principle of the torrent \hyperlink{struct_d_h_t}{D\+H\+T}\+: \href{http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html}{\tt http\+://www.\+bittorrent.\+org/beps/bep\+\_\+0005.\+html} (R\+E\+A\+D I\+T)

But\+: Vastly simplified packet format and encryption.

Boostrapping\+: The first time you install the client we bootstrap it with a node. (bandwidth should not be a problem as the client only needs to be sent one reply.)

\subsection*{Basics }

(All the numbers here are just guesses and are probably not optimal values)

client list\+: A list of node ids closest (mathematically see bittorrent doc) to ours matched with ip addresses + port number corresponding to that id and a timestamp containing the time or time since the client was successfully pinged.

\char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list\+: A list containing the node\+\_\+ids of all our \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} or clients we want to connect to. Also contains the ip addresses + port + node\+\_\+ids + timestamp(of last ping like in the client list) of the 8 clients closest (mathematically see bittorrent doc) to each \char`\"{}friend\char`\"{}

One pinged lists\+: -\/\+One for storing a list of ips along with their ping\+\_\+ids and a timestamp for the ping requests Entries in the pinged lists expire after 5 seconds. If one of the lists becomes full, the expire rate reduces itself one second or the new ping takes the place of the oldest one.

Entries in client list and \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list expire after 300 seconds without ping response. Each client stores a maximum of 32 entries in its client list. Each client in the client list and \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list is pinged every 60 seconds. Each client in the client list and \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list has a timestamp which denote the last time it was successfully pinged. If the corresponding clients timestamp is more than 130 seconds old it is considered bad. Send a get nodes request every 20 seconds to a random good node for each \char`\"{}friend\char`\"{} in our \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list. Send a get nodes request every 20 seconds to a random good node in the client list.

\subsection*{When a client receives any request from another }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Respond to the request
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ping request is replied to with with a ping response containing the same encrypted data
\item Get nodes request is replied with a send nodes reply containing the same encrypted data and the good nodes from the client list and/or the \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list that are closest to the requested\+\_\+node\+\_\+id
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If the requesting client is not in the client list\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If there are no bad clients in the list and the list is full\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the id of the other client is closer (mathematically see bittorrent doc) than at least one of the clients in the list or our \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Send a ping request to the client.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item if not forget about the client.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If there are bad clients and/or the list isn't full\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Send a ping request to the client
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{When a client receives a response }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ping response
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node was previously pinged with a matching ping\+\_\+id (check in the corresponding pinged list.)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node is in the client list the matching client's timestamp is set to current time.
\item If the node is in the \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list the matching client's timestamp is set to current time for every occurrence.
\item If the node is not in the client list\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the list isn't full, add it to the list.
\item If the list is full, the furthest away (mathematically see bittorrent doc) bad client is replaced by the new one.
\item If the list is filled with good nodes replace the furthest client with it only if it is closer than the replaced node.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item for each friend in the \char`\"{}friends\char`\"{} list\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If that friend's client list isn't full, add that client to it
\item If that friend's client list contains bad clients, replace the furthest one with that client.
\item If that friend's client list contains only good clients
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the client is closer to the friend than one of the other clients, it replaces the farthest one
\item If not, nothing happens.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Send nodes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the ping\+\_\+id matches what we sent previously (check in the corresponding pinged list.)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each node in the response is pinged.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
