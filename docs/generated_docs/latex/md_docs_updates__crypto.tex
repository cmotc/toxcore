Encryption library used\+: \href{http://nacl.cr.yp.to/}{\tt http\+://nacl.\+cr.\+yp.\+to/}

When running the program for the first time the crypto\+\_\+box\+\_\+keypair() function is used to generate the users public-\/private key pair. (32 bytes each)

The generated public key is set as the client\+\_\+id of the peer.

\subsection*{Adding a friend }

Alice adds bob to her friends list by adding his 32 byte public key (client\+\_\+id) to her friends list. 2 cases\+: case 1\+: Alice adds Bobs public key and bob waits for Alice to attempt to connect to him. case 2\+: Bob and Alice add their respective public keys to their friends list at the same time.

case 1\+: Alice sends a onion data (see\+: Prevent\+\_\+tracking.\+txt) packet to bob with the encrypted part containing the friends request like so\+: ``` \mbox{[}char with a value of 32\mbox{]}\mbox{[}nospam number (4 bytes)\mbox{]}\mbox{[}Message\mbox{]} ```

Ex message\+: hello bob it's me alice -\/\+\_\+-\/ add me pl0x.

For more info on the nospam see\+: Spam\+\_\+\+Prevention.\+txt

Bob receives the request and decrypts the message using the function crypto\+\_\+box\+\_\+open()

If the message decrypts successfully\+: If Alice is already in Bobs friends list\+: case 2 If Alice is not in Bob's friends list and the nospam is good\+: Bob is prompt to add Alice and is shown the message from her. If Bobs accepts Alice's friends request he adds her public key to his friends list.

case 2\+: Bob and Alice both have the others public key in their friends list, they are ready for the next step\+: Connecting to an already added friend

In the next step only crypto\+\_\+box() is used for encryption and only crypto\+\_\+box\+\_\+open() for decryption (just like in the last step.)

\subsection*{Connecting to an already added friend }

\subsection*{Crypto request packets }

``` \mbox{[}char with a value of 32\mbox{]}\mbox{[}Bob's (The reciever's) Public key (client\+\_\+id) (32 bytes))\mbox{]}\mbox{[}Alice's (The sender's) Public key (client\+\_\+id) (32 bytes)\mbox{]}\mbox{[}Random nonce (24 bytes)\mbox{]}\mbox{[}Encrypted message\mbox{]} ```

The encrypted message is encrypted with crypto\+\_\+box() (using Bobs public key, Alice's private key and the nonce (randomly generated 24 bytes)) and is a message from Alice in which she tells Bob who she is.

Each node can route the request to the receiver if they are connected to him. This is to bypass bad N\+A\+Ts.
